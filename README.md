# Badreads

## Description
Badreads is a web application that allows users to select a book from a list of available titles, write and post reviews, save their reviewed books to their account, tag books with attributes of why they didn't like the book from a select list, and rate books based on a scale of poop emojis from 1 to 5. This platform provides book enthusiasts with a space to share their thoughts on different horrible books and discover which reads to avoid based on user reviews and ratings.

## Future Ideas
The following features are planned for future development on the Badreads web app:
- **Login Feature:** Implement a user login and authentication system to allow users to have personalized accounts and access their saved reviews and preferences.
- **Multi-User Support:** Enable multiple users to create accounts and interact with each other's reviews and book lists.
- **Attribute Tag Search:** Allow users to search for books based on specific attribute tags provided in reviews.
- **Like and Comment System:** Implement a liking and commenting feature on other users' reviews to encourage engagement and discussions.
